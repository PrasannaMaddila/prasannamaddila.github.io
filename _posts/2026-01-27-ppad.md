It's been a while coming, but this is my first post related to my thesis, and it's on the famous PPAD complexity class. It's a curious complexity class, and it characterises the hardness of finding Nash Equilibria in games. In fact, you can say many statements of the form: 

<div class="thm" text="PPAD-Completeness">
Finding an $\epsilon$-Nash Equiliibrium in a "game" is PPAD-Complete, where "game" can be:
1. a 2-player, general-sum normal form game [1].
2. a general-sum stochastic game [2], played over an infinite horizon.
</ol>
where $\epsilon$ is some parameter that can depend on polynomial factors of the game, like the number of actions, players etc.
</div>

## But what is PPAD ?

PPAD is a complexity class whose original "Complete" problem is called End-of-the-Line. Roughly speaking (Refer [3]), End-of-the-Line can be given as the following search problem:


<div class="defn" text="End-of-the-Line">
- Input: an exponentially large set of nodes, $[2^n]$, each with in-degree and out-degree at most 1. The first node is guaranteed to be a source i.e. in-degree = 0.
- Output: Find a sink of this graph i.e. a node with out-degree=0, or any other source.
</div>

Sounds easy, doesn't it ? That's until you realise that in the worst case, we have to go through all possible nodes. There is no nice edge structure, in the general case, that allows us to simplify the search. Otherwise stated, the edeges of this exponentially large graph can be randomly ordered. For example, take the path graph $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow 2^n$. Unless you already know this is the path graph, you have to go through each one.

Here's the last kicker of this show: a Nash Equilibrium (in mixed strategies) is guaranteed to exist (for all interesting classes of games). The basic result for normal-form games with finite action spaces (think actions $1,2,\ldots,n$ for a finite number of players). _In other words, this equilibrium always exists. We just can't find it (in reasonable time)._ You can say that the search problem is "total" and so PPAD falls under the TFNP complexity class, since the solution is guaranteed to exist (although don't quiz me too much on this).

## Approximability

In fact, let's take a close look at the search problem for 2-player zero-sum games.

<div class="defn" text="Poly-Bimatrix[1]">
- *Input*: 2 $n \times n$ matrices $B_1, B_2$, and some constant $c$.
- *Output*: An $n^{-c}$-Nash Equilibrium of this game.
</div>

Well, the interesting part of this post is that this problem rules out the existence of Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (FPTASes) for PPAD-Complete problems (modulo a miracle). An FPTAS for a problem is an algorithm that 
- takes an instance $\Gamma$ and a precision $\epsilon$,
- returns an $\epsilon$-approximate solution
- and its runtime is polynomial in the instance parameters $\mathrm{poly}(\Gamma)$ and in $1/epsilon$.

So for example, an FPTAS might have $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ runtime in the precision. So, suppose that you do in fact have an FPTAS for a PPAD-complete problem, say Poly-Bimatrix. Then, I can choose for all instances of Poly-BIMATRIX some $\epsilon < n^{-c}$, and solve it, in polynomial time. So, for any constant $\varepsilon$ that you can choose, I can produce a polytime algorithm to solve the associated search problem. 

Since Poly-Bimatrix is PPAD-Complete, we've just shown that all PPAD-Complete/Hard problems can be solved in polynomial time. This is widely believed not to be possible, since we think that PPAD is a "difficult" class.

## PPAD is supposedly difficult

We think PPAD is a difficult class to solve, since (See [5])

- finding a second Nash equilibrium in a game is NP-Complete, even in 2-player games 
- finding an NE that maximises social welfare is NP-Hard.
- finding an NE that guarantees a minimum payoff for each player is also NP-hard.

and so on. The analogy is that in all of these cases, NE + (second property) removes the existence guarantee of Nash, which only guarantees the first NE (in mixed strategies). Once that's out of the way, it becomes more clear that we can only search an exponentially large space. On the other hand, it's easy to verify that a given strategy $(x,y)$ is an $epsilon$-NE: it's just solving (for example, for the first player),

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{x'} r(x',y) - r(x,y) \leq \epsilon \iff \max_{a} r(a,y) - r(x,y) \leq \epsilon
\end{align}
$$

We can just iterate over the payoffs over the pure actions since the mixed strategy is just a convex combination of the best pure payoffs. This is clearly linear in the action space, making this an easy-to-verify problem i.e. it is in NP. Hardness, however, as you've seen, is a different thing entirely.

Isn't that neat ?
