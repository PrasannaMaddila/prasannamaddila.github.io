title: "About Me"
---

I'm Prasanna, a doctoral student at the [University of Toulouse](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr) at the [MIAT](https://miat.inrae.fr) Lab, INRAE. Before that, I was an engineering student at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/), Paris, where I studied Computer Science (Sciences du Logiciel).

In my PhD work, I study Nash Equilibrium computation in multi-agent games, either by exact methods (such as approximation schemes), or by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning techniques. In particular, I focus on a class of multi-agent games where a team has to play against multiple independent adversaries, in both one-shot and stochastic settings. These games are interesting since they arise in natural scenarios like Anti-Poaching / Green Security, and involve both competitive and cooperative behaviour.

When I'm not at the lab, I consume all things 

- code (especially with HPC/AI flavours like JAX and C++),
- chess (50-50 record against [Lichess](https://lichess.org)'s Level 4 Bot)
- literature,
- and food, naturally.
