I'm Prasanna, a doctoral student at the University of Toulouse III. My subject is on developing reinforcement learning approaches to multi-agent games. In particular, I focus on a class of multi-agent, partially observable stochastic games with both cooperative and competitive behaviour.

While I'm not at work, I consume all things code, chess, books and literature. Otherwise, you'll probably find me hogging ramen somewhere :)
