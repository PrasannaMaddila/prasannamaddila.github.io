I try to organise personal news by theme so it's easier to walk through. Better organisation suggestions are always welcome (and might even be necessary) !

## Papers and Publications

### Multi-Adversarial Team Games 

Multi-Adversarial Team Gamea model the team vs. independent adversary dynamic that is central to APE. We model this first as a normal form game, where we show that equilibria in this game are poly-time approximable.

- (Paper, [AAMAS 2026](https://hal.science/view/index/docid/5450199)) Our paper on Multi-Adversarial Team Games has been accepted to AAMAS 2026 ! The algorithm is also provided as an implementation here: [Code](https://forge.inrae.fr/chip-gt/multi-adversarial-team-games). See all of you in Cyprus this May !
- (Workshop, [Mannheim](https://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/doering/conferences/rl-2025/)) Presented a poster and attended the Workshop on Reinforcement Learning at Mannheim, this 7th February, 2025. 


### Anti-Poaching Environment 

This is the body of work we produced on modelling Anti-Poaching as a partially observable stochastic game. This is the first environment in this space with a theoretical model and a reference implementation ([Code: APE](https://forge.inrae.fr/chip-gt/antipoaching))

- ([JFSMA 2024](https://easychair.org/cfp/jfsma2024))([Paper](https://hal.science/hal-04699116))  I'll be presenting our work at the 32nd (-ième?) Journées Francophones sur les Systèmes Multi-Agents at Cargèse, Corsica this year. Find me there between 5-9 November !
- ([EWRL 2024](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl17-2024/))([Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JSWRnHC93W&noteId=JSWRnHC93W)) Presenting a poster at the 17th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning, held at Toulouse this year!
- ([WLiG 2024](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/10543/overview))([Paper](https://hal.science/hal-04701220)) Attended the Workshop on Learning in Games held at the IMT, Toulouse, and presented a poster.
- ([ROADEF 2024](https://roadef2024.sciencesconf.org/?lang=fr))([Paper](https://roadef2024.sciencesconf.org/511462)) Presented the Anti-Poaching Game at ROADEF 2024, held in Amiens. 

## Teaching

In addition to my PhD work, I also teach at the University of Toulouse. This is usually a 12-hour primer on Deep Learning for the students of the MSE Master.

- (Teaching, [Deep Learning](https://forgemia.inra.fr/siva-sri-prasanna.maddila/course-deeplearning-mse-m2)) Really enjoyed teaching the students of the MSE Master this year as well ! Merry Christmas, everyone :)
- (Math Festival, [Les Maths en Scène](https://lesmathsenscene.fr/festival/festival-2025/poles-du-festival-2025/)) Had the pleasure to animate an atelier on the Nash Equilibrium for schoolchildren this year. Huge thanks to [Les Maths En Scène](https://lesmathsenscene.fr) and everyone for the opportunity, and also for guiding me throughout !
- (Teaching, [Deep Learning](https://forgemia.inra.fr/siva-sri-prasanna.maddila/course-deeplearning-mse-m2)) I've had the pleasure to give a short introductory course on Deep Learning to the students of the MSE Master at the University of Toulouse III :)
